Zen of phoenicz
===============

Reliability and stability >>>>>>> performance and speed.

phoenicz should never crash, and should always be able to restart and/or repair
herself.

Presume that the users will abuse, that the computer is crap and the
programmers are idiots. Program thereafter. Nothing is safe, nothing is
certain. Always prepare for the worst.

Everything (or as close as possible) should be reloadable and switchable during
runtime.

Everything should be en English, except personality-related things (i.e.
plugins).

When there are multiple ways of doing something, choose one of them. Not all of
them.

Simple and stupid is better than complex and clever.

Flat is better than nested.

Testing is everything.
